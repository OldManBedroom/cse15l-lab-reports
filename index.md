This tutorial is written for Windows users,
If you are using a different operation system, I can't promise this will work for you.


1. Installing VScode:

I already have VScode on my computer, so I am going to skip this step.
After successfully installing VScode, you window should look like this: (It doesn't have to be exact same)

2. Remotely Connecting:

If you are using Windows like me, you need to download Git first. Use this link to download: https://gitforwindows.org/

Now open the terminal in your VScode. Select Git Bash as the default profile.
Click the "+" icon to create a new Bash terminal window.
Now your terminal window should be something like this:

Before we move forward, make sure to reset your password for this course account using this link: https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php

Next, type ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu in your terminal and replace the "zz" with the letters in your course account.
Type enter and you will see a warning. Type yes and enter to continue.
Type the password you just resetted and you should be connected to the server.
Your terminal should look like this:

Now you are all set to try some commands.

Reminder: if you stay inactive for a long time, you will need to login again.

3. Trying some Command:

You can type in some commands you learned in the class in the terminal to see what will happen.
For example: ls, cd, pwd.

Here are some of my attempts:

It's my pleasure if this tutorial gives you any help.
